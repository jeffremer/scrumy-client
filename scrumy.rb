# **Scrumy Client** is a Ruby REST client wrapper for [Scrumy](http://apidoc.scrumy.com).
#
# Scrumy Client provides a simple client interface for retrieving Sprints, Stories,
# Tasks, and Scrumers, as well as some tools for generating useful information with
# those objects.

# The [source code](https://github.com/jeffremer/scrumy-client) is available on Github.

# Dependencies
# ============

# We need JSON

# JSON responses are parsed and turned into the core Scrumy objects, key value
# pairs in the JSON hashes become instance variables in the objects.
require 'json'


# Scrumy Client uses [rest-client](https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client)
# for conveniently retrieving REST resources and handling some of the HTTP at a
# higher level.
require 'rest_client'

# We use [ActiveSupport::Inflector](http://as.rubyonrails.org/classes/Inflector.html) to do some of the metaprogramming magic and
# instantiate classes and create methods dynamically.  Inflector helps to
# pluralize, singularize, (de)modularize symbols.
require 'active_support/inflector'

    # Just call client.url to see that last requested URL.

    # This is the heart of the `Scrumy::Client` object.  It provides Ghost Methods via the Ruby
    # chainsaw, `method_missing`.
    
    # The magic comes from the fact that the Scrumy REST API uses mostly deterministic URLS
    # based on relationships between models.  Scrums have Sprints, Sprints have Stories,
    # Stories have Tasks, Tasks have one Scrumer.

  # Models
  # ======
  #
  # Scrumy defines several models, each of which have a corresponding REST resource.
  #
  # * Scrumy (not yet implemented here)
  # * Sprint
  # * Story
  # * Task
  # * Scrumer
  # * Snapshot (implemented in client, but not as a model yet)
  #
  # For now the models are explicitly defined, but they contain virtually no code
  # or can act simply as extensions to provide information not contain directly
  # in the REST resource.

  class Sprint < Scrumy::Model
    # Specify the parent as `:scrumy` even though we're not specifying it as a 
    # resource - it'll just act as the root resource.
    belongs_to :scrumy
    # `Sprints` have many lazily loaded `Scrumy::Story` objects.
    lazy_load :stories
    
    # list "scrumies/:project/:sprints"
    # show "sprints/:id"
  end
  
  class Story < Scrumy::Model
    # `Scrumy::Story` objects belong to `Scrumy::Sprint` objects
    belongs_to :sprint
    # and can lazy load many `Scrumy::Task` objects
    lazy_load :tasks
  end
  
  class Task < Scrumy::Model
    # `Scrumy::Task` objects belong to `Scrumy::Story` objects    
    belongs_to :story
    # and can lazy load one `Scrumy::Scrumer`
    lazy_load :scrumer
    
    # This defines a helper method Scrumy::Task`#time`
    def time
      # Since time is only in the title text this captures it
      return 3.0 if !(@title =~ /\((\d+.*)([hHmM].*)\)/)      
      time, unit = $~.captures
      # and converts it into hours or fractions thereof
      unit =~ /m/i ? time.to_f / 60.0 : time.to_f      
    end
  end

  # While `Scrumy::Tasks` have `Scrumy::Scrumers` the actual resource
  # reside under the root :scrumy resource, so explicitly load it from there
  # `#belongs_to` and `#lazy_load` relationships don't have to be bidirectional
  class Scrumer < Scrumy::Model
    belongs_to :scrumy
  end
